# Smart_Attendence_System_Graduation_Project

In light of the need for social distancing following Covid-19 we have designed a system that addresses the problem of student attendance in faculty. They were utilizing a paper-based approach to keep track of their attendance for students to take attendance, a (face recognition, fingerprint , and QR code) will be provided. The professor is in charge of determining whether or not all of the pupils in the group or class are present. To authenticate their attendance and exit, users will only need their smartphones.

We are developing a smart attendance system to replace traditional paper-based methods which facilitates the absence process  as it :
Increased accuracy and simplified attendance recording.

Time and Effort Savings.

Reduction in manual data entry and decreased the errors.

Easy monitoring of students' attendance.

Face or fingerprint recognition for secure attendance tracking.

Protection against cheating and fraud.
